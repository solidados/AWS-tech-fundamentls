# VLANs, TRUNKS & QinQ
In computer networking, a VLAN, or Virtual Local Area Network, is a way to divide a single physical network into multiple logical 
networks.  

VLANs are commonly used to improve network performance, security, and manageability. 

Trunks are a way to carry VLAN traffic between network switches, while QinQ is a VLAN stacking technique that allows multiple VLAN tags 
to be added to a single Ethernet frame. 

Herewith, I will cover the basics of VLANs, including how they work & their benefits and drawbacks.  
I will also explore trunks and QinQ,
and discuss how they can be used to extend VLANs across multiple switches and through service provider networks.
